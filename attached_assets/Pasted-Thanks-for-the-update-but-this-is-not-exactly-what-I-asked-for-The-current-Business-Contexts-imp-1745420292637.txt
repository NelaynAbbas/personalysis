Thanks for the update, but this is not exactly what I asked for. The current “Business Contexts” implementation is too static and separate from the core idea of the platform.

Let me clarify again — this platform is designed to be used by marketing agencies, who will run personalized, gamified surveys for each of their clients’ target audiences, not for themselves. Here’s what I actually need:

✅ What needs to happen:
Surveys must be personalized dynamically per client/project
Agencies should be able to:

Create a new survey instance tailored to a specific product, service, or startup idea

Input competitor info, product descriptions, target segments, or positioning details (e.g. URLs, keywords, features)

Have this context guide the survey personalization behind the scenes (prompt injection, tone changes, question logic, etc.)

Surveys collect data indirectly for that specific context
No static business profile form.
The survey itself must gather market insights using indirect, gamified questions, and automatically adapt or reference the specific context (product, market, competitors) that was set.

AI analysis layer combines both sources
After responses come in, the AI should:

Pull in additional web context (from competitors’ websites, industry trends, etc.)

Merge that with survey data

Output strategic insights into the client dashboard (e.g. positioning recommendations, unmet market needs, product perception, etc.)

Dashboard for agencies & their clients
Ensure the results are shown:

In a clean dashboard specific to each project

With breakdowns by segments, psychographics, and AI‑driven analysis

In a way that agencies can export or present to their clients easily

🎯 The core principle: Surveys are the tool for market research, dynamically adjusted for each case — not just a form system to store static business data.

Please rework the feature accordingly and let me know what’s needed to support this shift. I’m happy to clarify more or review the survey personalization logic with you.
