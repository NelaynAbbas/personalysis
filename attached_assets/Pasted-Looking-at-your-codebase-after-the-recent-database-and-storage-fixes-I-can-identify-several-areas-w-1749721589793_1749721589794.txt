Looking at your codebase after the recent database and storage fixes, I can identify several areas with hardcoded functionalities and potential bugs that need to be addressed for a production-ready platform. Let me analyze the key issues:

Major Issues Found:
1. Client Management Component - Hardcoded Values and Logic Issues
The ClientManagement.tsx has several hardcoded values and potential bugs:

client/src/components/admin/ClientManagement.tsx
Fix hardcoded values and improve error handling in ClientManagement
2. Dashboard Component - Hardcoded Company ID and User Management
client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
Fix hardcoded user management and improve error handling
3. Admin Console Component - Remove Hardcoded Demo Account Logic
client/src/pages/AdminConsole.tsx
Remove hardcoded admin checks and improve authentication
4. Demo Data Routes - Remove Production Hardcoded Data
server/routes/demoData.ts
Add environment check to prevent demo data in production
5. Business Intelligence Component - Fix Hardcoded Data Handling
client/src/components/dashboard/BusinessIntelligenceFix.tsx
Fix data validation and error handling
6. Create Environment Configuration File
server/config/environment.ts
Add centralized environment configuration
7. Fix User Management Storage Functions
server/database-storage-user-management.ts
Add proper validation and error handling
Critical Issues Summary:
Hardcoded Demo Data: Remove demo data routes in production
Hardcoded User IDs: Replace with dynamic user session management
Missing Environment Configuration: Add proper environment variable management
Inconsistent Error Handling: Standardize error responses across components
Hardcoded Company IDs: Make company associations dynamic
Missing Data Validation: Add proper input validation on all forms
Inconsistent Authentication: Standardize auth checks across admin and client areas
The platform needs these fixes to be production-ready. The main issues are around hardcoded values, inconsistent error handling, and missing environment-based configuration management.
