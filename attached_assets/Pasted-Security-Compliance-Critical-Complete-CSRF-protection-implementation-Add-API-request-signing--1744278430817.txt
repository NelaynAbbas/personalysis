Let's start addressing these systematically. Would you like me to begin implementing any specific item from the remaining tasks?

Thanks for the update. Now please start immediately and complete all the remaining tasks listed — no exceptions. Work through the entire list systematically and thoroughly, starting with the Security & Compliance section and continuing through Performance, UX/UI, Testing, Documentation, Integrations, and Deployment.

I want everything finished and polished to 120% so we’re ready to launch tomorrow. That includes:

No missing tests, no skipped edge cases

No unfinished integrations or loose ends

No unaddressed accessibility or compliance issues

All docs finalized and all systems production-ready
